# KDE Post-Install

This repo hosts some of the software that I use, and stuff that I normally have to do after installing Arch Linux and KDE Plasma 6.

Having to copy paste each time to install stuff, I decided to make this so it is an easier way for me to do thing after reinstalls.

This repo will have:
- creating user dirs
- installing reflector and its settings
- installing yay
- installing fonts
- installing firewall
- installing software (pacman)
- installing software (yay)

Besides the above, it will also have the following:
- Moving wallpapers to ~/Pictures
- Moving config files from SSD to ~/.config
